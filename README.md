# Analysing-Chinook-DBusing-SQL
In this project we imagine ourselves to be a data analysis company assigned with the task of analyzing the business of a fictitious online music store that is about to be purchased by a very big music record label. The label wants to ensure that the health of the business is good before they go about purchasing the music store.

Using SQLite and the Matplotlib library we analyze the dataset based on a number of questions the label has put forward regarding the online music store. The answers for the same are based entirely on the dataset provided.
